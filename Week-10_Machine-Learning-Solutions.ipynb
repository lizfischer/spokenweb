",

",

",

",

",

",
"So far from hence!
",

",
"It chiefly consisted of household linen, plate, china, and books, with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne's.
",
"
",
"Many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so much beloved.
",
"
",
"After winding along it for more than a mile, they reached their own house.
",
"
",
"A small green court was the whole of its demesne in front; and a neat wicket gate admitted them into it.
",
"
",
"A narrow passage led directly through the house into the garden behind.
",
"
",
"High hills rose immediately behind, and at no great distance on each side; some of which were open downs, the others cultivated and woody.
",
"
",
"The village of Barton was chiefly on one of these hills, and formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows.
",
"
",
"The prospect in front was more extensive; it commanded the whole of the valley, and reached into the country beyond.
",
"
",
"The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in that direction; under another name, and in another course, it branched out again between two of the steepest of them.
",
"
",
"His kindness was not confined to words; for within an hour after he left them, a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park, which was followed before the end of the day by a present of game.
",
"
",
"The ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley, but it was screened from their view at home by the projection of a hill.
",
"
",
"He was silent and grave.
",
"
",
""Infirmity!"
",
"
",
""But he talked of flannel waistcoats," said Marianne; "and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches, cramps, rheumatisms, and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble."
",
"
",
"Confess, Marianne, is not there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek, hollow eye, and quick pulse of a fever?"
",
"
",
""How strange this is!
",
"
",
"The whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks.
",
"
",
"They gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in their own penetration at every glimpse of blue sky; and when they caught in their faces the animating gales of a high south-westerly wind, they pitied the fears which had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing such delightful sensations.
",
"
",
"Margaret agreed, and they pursued their way against the wind, resisting it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer, when suddenly the clouds united over their heads, and a driving rain set full in their face.-- Chagrined and surprised, they were obliged, though unwillingly, to turn back, for no shelter was nearer than their own house.
",
"
",
"One consolation however remained for them, to which the exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety; it was that of running with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate.
",
"
",
"They set off.
",
"
",
"A gentleman carrying a gun, with two pointers playing round him, was passing up the hill and within a few yards of Marianne, when her accident happened.
",
"
",
"He put down his gun and ran to her assistance.
",
"
",
""Willoughby!"
",
"
",
"A very decent shot, and there is not a bolder rider in England."
",
"
",
"But he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow, and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw.
",
"
",
""Where does he come from?
",
"
",
"--  "Elinor," cried Marianne, "is this fair?
",
"
",
"are my ideas so scanty?
",
"
",
"Yet such was the case.
",
"
",
"Willoughby was out of the question.
",
"
",
"Margaret related something to her the next day, which placed this matter in a still clearer light.
",
"
",
""What is the gentleman's name?"
",
"
",
"The morning was rather favourable, though it had rained all night, as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky, and the sun frequently appeared.
",
"
",
""What is the matter with Brandon?"
",
"
",
"Come, come, this won't do, Colonel; so let us hear the truth of it."
",
"
",
"What a blow upon them all was this!
",
"
",
"He shook his head.
",
"
",
"Brandon is one of them.
",
"
",
"I shall then go post."
",
"
",
"Willoughby."
",
"
",
"On one side you look across the bowling-green, behind the house, to a beautiful hanging wood, and on the other you have a view of the church and village, and, beyond them, of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired.
",
"
",
"Poor man!
",
"
",
"They were no sooner in the passage than Marianne came hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction, with her handkerchief at her eyes; and without noticing them ran up stairs.
",
"
",
""Almost this moment."
",
"
",
""This is very unfortunate.
",
"
",
"To the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves, though unavoidably secret for a while?
",
"
",
""How strange this is!
",
"
",
""A mighty concession indeed!
",
"
",
"But why?
",
"
",
""Months!"
",
"
",
"They walked along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence, for Marianne's MIND could not be controlled, and Elinor, satisfied with gaining one point, would not then attempt more.
",
"
",
"His air, his coat, his horse.
",
"
",
"The woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves."
",
"
",
""It is not every one," said Elinor, "who has your passion for dead leaves."
",
"
",
"But SOMETIMES they are."
",
"
",
"And there, beneath that farthest hill, which rises with such grandeur, is our cottage."
",
"
",
""How strange!"
",
"
",
"His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all, and his interest in their welfare again became perceptible.
",
"
",
"Thank Heaven!
",
"
",
""Strange that it would!"
",
"
",
""About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year; not more than THAT."
",
"
",
"Elinor laughed.
",
"
",
""TWO thousand a year!
",
"
",
"ONE is my wealth!
",
"
",
""Hunters!"
",
"
",
"repeated Edward--"but why must you have hunters?
",
"
",
""And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the authors or their heirs."
",
"
",
""Undoubtedly.
",
"
",
"My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of the understanding.
",
"
",
"Edward started--"Reserved!
",
"
",
"His gravity and thoughtfulness returned on him in their fullest extent--and he sat for some time silent and dull.
",
"
",
"I call it a very fine country--the hills are steep, the woods seem full of fine timber, and the valley looks comfortable and snug--with rich meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there.
",
"
",
"I like a fine prospect, but not on picturesque principles.
",
"
",
"I do not like crooked, twisted, blasted trees.
",
"
",
"I admire them much more if they are tall, straight, and flourishing.
",
"
",
""Who!
",
"
",
"This, and Marianne's blushing, gave new suspicions to Edward.
",
"
",
"He said so repeatedly; other things he said too, which marked the turn of his feelings and gave the lie to his actions.
",
"
",
"The old well-established grievance of duty against will, parent against child, was the cause of all.
",
"
",
"In feeling, in action, in condition, in every thing."
",
"
",
""Hush!
",
"
",
""Where is Marianne?
",
"
",
"all alone!
",
"
",
"Palmer?"
",
"
",
"He immediately went into the passage, opened the front door, and ushered her in himself.
",
"
",
"He then made his bow, and departed with the rest.
",
"
",
""Ah, well!
",
"
",
"Now, pray do,--and come while the Westons are with us.
",
"
",
"But, poor fellow!
",
"
",
"Palmer?"
",
"
",
"Don't palm all your abuses of languages upon me."
",
"
",
"Sometimes he won't speak to me for half a day together, and then he comes out with something so droll--all about any thing in the world."
",
"
",
"Palmer!"
",
"
",
"It is a sweet place, by all accounts."
",
"
",
"Benevolent, philanthropic man!
",
"
",
"They have brought the whole coach full of playthings for the children.
",
"
",
""Poor little creatures!"
",

",

",

",

",

",
"
",
"[At this point in the first and second editions, Volume 1 ends.]
",
"
",
"What a softener of the heart was this persuasion!
",
"
",
"They all rose up in preparation for a round game.
",
"
",
"The remaining five were now to draw their cards.
",
"
",
"Lucy made room for her with ready attention, and the two fair rivals were thus seated side by side at the same table, and, with the utmost harmony, engaged in forwarding the same work.
",
"
",
"CHAPTER 24   In a firm, though cautious tone, Elinor thus began.
",
"
",
"Lucy went on.
",
"
",
"Lucy looked at Elinor again, and was silent.
",
"
",
"At length Lucy exclaimed with a deep sigh,  "I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at once by dissolving the engagement.
",
"
",
"Another pause therefore of many minutes' duration, succeeded this speech, and Lucy was still the first to end it.
",
"
",
""Oh, Lord!
",
"
",
"Lord bless me!
",
"
",
"This decided the matter at once.
",
"
",
"Ah!
",
"
",
"poor man!
",
"
",
"he has been dead these eight years and better.
",
"
",

"This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country."
",
"
",
""Ay, my dear, I'll warrant you we do.
",
"
",
"I can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff.
",
"
",
"The clouds seem parting too, the sun will be out in a moment, and we shall have a clear afternoon."
",
"
",
"Elinor was alternately diverted and pained; but Marianne persevered, and saw every night in the brightness of the fire, and every morning in the appearance of the atmosphere, the certain symptoms of approaching frost.
",
"
",
""Good God!"
",
"
",
""For me!"
",
"
",
""Me!"
",
"
",
""Nor I," answered Marianne with energy, "our situations then are alike.
",
"
",
"And thus ended their discourse.
",
"
",
""Invited!"
",
"
",
"Will you not shake hands with me?"
",
"
",
"Tell me, Willoughby; for heaven's sake tell me, what is the matter?"
",
"
",
"This is not the place for explanations.
",
"
",
"Come, come, this won't do.
",
"
",
"Elinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief in silence.
",
"
",
"Ah!
",
"
",
""Many, many circumstances," said Elinor, solemnly.
",
"
",

"This lock of hair, which now he can so readily give up, was begged of me with the most earnest supplication.
",
"
",
"Again they were both silent.
",
"
",
"Who regards me?"
",
"
",
"Ay, it is but too true.
",
"
",
""Poor soul!"
",
"
",

"and by all accounts, it won't come before it's wanted; for they say he is all to pieces.
",
"
",
"dashing about with his curricle and hunters!
",
"
",
"Why don't he, in such a case, sell his horses, let his house, turn off his servants, and make a thorough reform at once?
",

",
"--  "And who are the Ellisons?"

",
""Ah!"
",

",

",
"
",
"Our ages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends.
",
"
",
"Ah!
",
"
",
"exclaimed Elinor.
",
"
",
"He wished him at the devil with all his heart.
",
"
",
"Such a scoundrel of a fellow!
",
"
",
"such a deceitful dog!
",

",
"and this was the end of it!"
",

",

",

",
"'Lord!
",

",
"The Doctor is no beau of mine."
",
"
",
""Aye, aye, that is very pretty talking--but it won't do--the Doctor is the man, I see."
",
"
",
"Lucy was silenced.
",
"
",
"The enclosure of Norland Common, now carrying on, is a most serious drain.
",
"
",
"And then I have made a little purchase within this half year; East Kingham Farm, you must remember the place, where old Gibson used to live.
",
"
",
""Where is the green-house to be?"
",
"
",
""Upon the knoll behind the house.
",
"
",
"The old walnut trees are all come down to make room for it.
",
"
",
"We have cleared away all the old thorns that grew in patches over the brow."
",
"
",
"Dorsetshire!
",
"
",
""Beautifully indeed!
",

",
"Lucy continued.
",
"
",
""Oh, don't think of me!"
",
"
",
"It checked the idleness of one, and the business of the other.
",
"
",
"In one of these excursive glances she perceived among a group of young men, the very he, who had given them a lecture on toothpick-cases at Gray's.
",
"
",
"He bestowed his hearty approbation however on their species of house.
",
"
",
"[At this point in the first and second editions, Volume II ended.]
",
"
",
""Something so strange!
",
"
",
"'Lord!'
",
"
",
"So then it all came out; and the long and the short of the matter, by all I can learn, seems to be this.
",
"
",
"'Lord!'
",
"
",
"So up he flew directly, and a terrible scene took place, for Lucy was come to them by that time, little dreaming what was going on.

",

",
"It had no park, but the pleasure-grounds were tolerably extensive; and like every other place of the same degree of importance, it had its open shrubbery, and closer wood walk, a road of smooth gravel winding round a plantation, led to the front, the lawn was dotted over with timber, the house itself was under the guardianship of the fir, the mountain-ash, and the acacia, and a thick screen of them altogether, interspersed with tall Lombardy poplars, shut out the offices.
",
"
",
"Prescriptions poured in from all quarters, and as usual, were all declined.
",
"
",
"Marianne was, of course, kept in ignorance of all these arrangements.
",
"
",
"The night was cold and stormy.
",
"
",
"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows; but Elinor, all happiness within, regarded it not.
",

",

",

",

",
"And the lock of hair--that too I had always carried about me in the same pocket-book, which was now searched by Madam with the most ingratiating virulence,--the dear lock--all, every memento was torn from me."
",

",
"Good bye."
",
"
",
"He held out his hand.
",
"
",
"I shall now go away and live in dread of one event."
",
"
",
"Good bye,--God bless you!"
",
"
",
"And with these words, he almost ran out of the room.
",
"
",
"Elinor's heart was full.
",
"
",
""At last we are alone.
",
"
",
"His was an involuntary confidence, an irrepressible effusion to a soothing friend--not an application to a parent.
",

",
"Elinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward.
",
"
",
"Marianne gave a violent start, fixed her eyes upon Elinor, saw her turning pale, and fell back in her chair in hysterics.
",
"
",
"This was gaining something, something to look forward to.
",
"
",
"He stopt at their gate.
",
"
",
"His errand at Barton, in fact, was a simple one.
",
"
",
"His heart was now open to Elinor, all its weaknesses, all its errors confessed, and his first boyish attachment to Lucy treated with all the philosophic dignity of twenty-four.
",
"
",
"He put the letter into Elinor's hands.
",
"
",
"Not a soul suspected anything of the matter, not even Nancy, who, poor soul!
",

",

",
"He was loved by the seamen and admired by the officers; and even when the Captain spoke to him, it was with a slight air of respect.
",
"
",
"Jack was a frank and charming man.
",
"
",
"No one could be better company in forecastle or saloon; no man told such stories, sang such songs, or with greater alacrity sprang to his duty.
",
"
",
"There was such an abounding air of good sense and good feeling about the man, that he who could not love him, would thereby pronounce himself a knave.
",
"
",
"His manners were easy and free; none of the boisterousness, so common to tars; and he had a polite, courteous way of saluting you, if it were only to borrow your knife.
",
"
",
"He talked of Rob Roy, Don Juan, and Pelham; Macbeth and Ulysses; but, above all things, was an ardent admirer of Camoens.
",
"
",
"Where he had obtained his wonderful accomplishments, it is not for me, his humble subordinate, to say.
",

",
"
",
"But with what purpose had he deserted?
",
"
",
"Not at all.
",
"
",
"At the time, his disappearance excited the utmost astonishment among the officers, who had little suspected him of any such conduct of deserting.
",
"
",
""What?
",
"
",
"cried the captain; "I'll not believe it."
",

",

",
"Is it so?"
",

",
"Adieu!
",
"
",
"Don Sereno, and Madre de Dios protect you?
",
"
",
"You have been a most gentlemanly friend and captain to me.
",

",
"I hope you will yet thrash your beggarly foes."
",
"
",
"On account of this wound in his shoulder, our Commodore had a body-servant's pay allowed him, in addition to his regular salary.
",
"
",
"I cannot say a great deal, personally, of the Commodore; he never sought my company at all, never extended any gentlemanly courtesies.
",
"
",
"But though I cannot say much of him personally, I can mention something of him in his general character, as a flag-officer.
",
"
",
"In the first place, then, I have serious doubts, whether for the most part, he was not dumb; for in my hearing, he seldom or never uttered a word.
",
"
",
"Perhaps he had an evil eye; may be he was the Wandering Jew afloat.
",
"
",
"One thing, perhaps, that more than anything else helped to make our Commodore so melancholy and forlorn, was the fact of his having so little to do.
",
"
",
"For as the frigate had a  captain; of course, so far as _she_ was concerned, our Commodore was a supernumerary.
",
"
",
"What abundance of leisure he must have had, during a three years' cruise; how indefinitely he might have been improving his mind!
",
"
",
"He messed with the Lieutenants in the Ward-room, where he had a state-room, elegantly furnished as the private cabinet of Pelham.
",
"
",
"But it seemed, he wrote the Commodore's dispatches for Washington, and also was his general amanuensis.
",
"
",
"It is not twelve o'clock till he says so.
",
"
",
"And the bell is struck eight by the messenger-boy, and twelve o'clock it is.
",
"
",
"All my soakings and drenchings lie at his state-room door.
",
"
",
"I hardly think I shall ever forgive him; every twinge of the rheumatism, which I still occasionally feel, is directly referable to him.
",
"
",
"The Immortals have a reputation for clemency; and _they_ may pardon him; but he must not dun me to be merciful.
",
"
",
"But my personal feelings toward the man shall not prevent me from here doing him justice.
",
"
",
"In most things he was an excellent seaman; prompt, loud, and to the point; and as such was well fitted for his station.
",
"
",
"The First Lieutenancy of a frigate demands a good disciplinarian, and, every way, an energetic man.
",
"
",
"They generally form a very agreeable club of good fellows; from their diversity of character, admirably calculated to form an agreeable social whole.
",
"
",
"Of course these gentlemen all associate on a footing of perfect social equality.
",
"
",
"Invariably four in number, they never have need to play whist with a dummy.
",
"
",
"They are messengers and errand-boys to their superiors.
",
"
",
"Mr. Pert advances, touches his hat, and remains in an attitude of deferential suspense.
",
"
",
"Mr. Pert, what are you doing at the table there, without your pantaloons?
",
"
",
"Let me see no more of this.
",
"
",
"If you disturb the ward-room again, young gentleman, you shall hear of it."
",
"
",
"And so saying, this hoary-headed Senior Lieutenant would retire to his cot in his state-room, like the father of a numerous family after getting up in his dressing-gown and slippers, to quiet a daybreak tumult in his populous nursery.
",
"
",
"It is indispensable that he should be a very Vidocq in vigilance.
",
"
",
"But as it is a heartless, so is it a thankless office.
",
"
",
"He who dines latest is the greatest man; and he who dines earliest is accounted the least.
",
"
",
"But how can this be, if you dine at five?
",
"
",
"What were a day without a dinner?
",
"
",
"such a day had better be a night.
",
"
",
"It is said, on good authority, that a Captain once ventured to dine at five, when the Commodore's hour was four.
",
"
",
"Eight o'clock for breakfast; twelve for dinner; four for supper; and no meals but these; no lunches and no cold snacks.
",
"
",
"Think of it!
",
"
",
"Before the Commodore has dined, you have supped.
",
"
",
"Mr. Secretary of the Navy, in the name of _the people_, you should interpose in this matter.
",
"
",
"We beg you, Mr. Secretary, not to be swayed in this matter by the Honourable Board of Commodores, who will no doubt tell you that eight, twelve, and four are the proper hours for _the people_ to take their Meals; inasmuch, as at these hours the watches are relieved.
",
"
",
"Of course, it was intended to be characteristic; and even so it was.
",
"
",
"As the cable enters the hawse-hole, therefore, something must be constantly used, to keep this travelling chain attached to this travelling _messenger_; something that may be rapidly wound round both, so as to bind them together.
",
"
",
"The article used is called a _selvagee_.
",
"
",
"And what could be better adapted to the purpose?
",
"
",
"Was it _you_, Selvagee!
",
"
",
"I do not _say_ it was you, Selvagee; I but deferentially inquire.
",
"
",
"On that rock many young gentlemen split.
",
"
",
"there was no getting the lavender out of you.
",
"
",
"The smallest favours in that way were thankfully received.
",
"
",
"But vain these pretences; he could not deceive.
",
"
",
"you know very well, that if it comes on to blow pretty hard, the First Lieutenant will be sure to interfere with his paternal authority.
",
"
",
"How unenviable his situation!
",
"
",
"His brother officers do not insult him, to be sure; but sometimes their looks are as daggers.
",
"
",
"He drinks.
",
"
",
"And so do we all.
",
"
",
"Very often, this bad habit got him into very serious scrapes.
",
"
",
"So far as his efficiency as a sea-officer was concerned, on shore at least, Jack might _bouse away_ as much as he pleased; but afloat it will not do at all.
",
"
",
"No privacy can you have; hardly one moment's seclusion.
",
"
",
"It is almost a physical impossibility, that you can ever be alone.
",
"
",
"You dine at a vast _table d'hote_; sleep in commons, and make your toilet where and when you can.
",
"
",
"The bell strikes to dinner, and hungry or not, you must dine.
",
"
",
"But they gain very little by this.
",
"
",
"If you lay anything down, and turn your back for a moment, ten to one it is gone.
",
"
",
"I proposed, that not only should my jacket keep me warm, but that it should also be so constructed as to contain a shirt or two, a pair of trowsers, and divers knick-knacks--sewing utensils, books, biscuits, and the like.
",
"
",
"Nay, it is desirable, that they should be of such a nature, that in a dark night, when you are in a great hurry--say, going to the helm--they may be jumped into, indiscriminately; and not be like a pair of right-and-left kids; neither of which will admit any hand, but the particular one meant for it.
",
"
",
"No; I told my good top-mate to go away with his four thumbs, I would have nothing to do with them; two thumbs were enough for any man.
",
"
",
"For some time after completing my jacket, and getting the furniture and household stores in it; I thought that nothing could exceed it for convenience.
",
"
",
"Seldom now did I have occasion to go to my bag, and be jostled by the crowd who were making their wardrobe in a heap.
",
"
",
"If I wanted anything in the way of clothing, thread, needles, or literature, the chances were that my invaluable jacket contained it.
",
"
",
"From the wild life they lead, and various other causes (needless to mention), sailors, as a class, entertain the most liberal notions concerning morality and the Decalogue; or rather, they take their own views of such matters, caring little for the theological or ethical definitions of others concerning what may be criminal, or wrong.
",
"
",
"They will covertly abstract a thing from one, whom they dislike; and insist upon it, that, in such a case, stealing is not robbing.
",
"
",
"This was more than once done in the Neversink.
",
"
",
"THE PURSUIT OF POETRY UNDER DIFFICULTIES.
",
"
",
"I had very early made the acquaintance of Lemsford.
",
"
",
"As may readily be imagined, the business of writing verse is a very different thing on the gun-deck of a frigate, from what the gentle and sequestered Wordsworth found it at placid Rydal Mount in Westmoreland.
",
"
",
"--"He's got a fit, hain't he?"
",
"
",
"Often he read over his effusions to me; and well worth the hearing they were.
",
"
",
"He had wit, imagination, feeling, and humour in abundance; and out of the very ridicule with which some persons regarded him, he made rare metrical sport, which we two together enjoyed by ourselves; or shared with certain select friends.
",
"
",
"And upon my word, noble Jack, with his native-born good sense, taste, and humanity, was not ill qualified to play the true part of a _Quarterly Review_;--which is, to give quarter at last, however severe the critique.
",
"
",
"Now Lemsford's great care, anxiety, and endless source of tribulation was the preservation of his manuscripts.
",
"
",
"This box, of course, he could not keep in his bag or hammock, for, in either case, he would only be able to get at it once in the twenty-four hours.
",
"
",
"It was necessary to have it accessible at all times.
",
"
",
"So when not using it, he was obliged to hide it out of sight, where he could.
",
"
",
"They hated his box, as if it had been Pandora's, crammed to the very lid with hurricanes and gales.
",
"
",
"Now, from this Quoin's vigilance, how could my poor friend the poet hope to escape with his box?
",
"
",
"and a loud threat, to pitch it overboard the next time, without a moment's warning, or benefit of clergy.
",
"
",
"Once, with an inconsolable countenance, he came to me, saying that his casket was nowhere to be found; he had sought for it in his hiding-place, and it was not there.
",
"
",
"I asked him where he had hidden it?
",
"
",
"But Quoin knew nothing about it.
",
"
",
"For ten mortal days the poet was not to be comforted; dividing his leisure time between cursing Quoin and lamenting his loss.
",
"
",
"The world is undone, he must have thought: no such calamity has befallen it since the Deluge;--my verses are perished.
",
"
",
"But though Quoin, as it afterward turned out, had indeed found the box, it so happened that he had not destroyed it; which no doubt led Lemsford to infer that a superintending Providence had interposed to preserve to posterity his invaluable casket.
",
"
",
"As has been seen, Quoin was full of unaccountable whimsies; he was, withal, a very cross, bitter, ill-natured, inflammable old man.
",
"
",
"But you will always observe, that the gunner's gang of every man-of-war are invariably ill-tempered, ugly featured, and quarrelsome.
",
"
",
"Now, there can be little doubt, that their being so much among the guns is the very thing that makes a gunner's gang so cross and quarrelsome.
",
"
",
"The truth seems to be, indeed, that all people should be very careful in selecting their callings and vocations; very careful in seeing to it, that they surround themselves by good-humoured, pleasant-looking objects; and agreeable, temper-soothing sounds.
",
"
",
"Many an angelic disposition has had its even edge turned, and hacked like a saw; and many a sweet draught of piety has soured on the heart from people's choosing ill-natured employments, and omitting to gather round them good-natured landscapes.
",
"
",
"It would be advisable for any man, who from an unlucky choice of a profession, which it is too late to change for another, should find his temper souring, to endeavour to counteract that misfortune, by filling his private chamber with amiable, pleasurable sights and sounds.
",
"
",
"In summer time, an Aeolian harp can be placed in your window at a very trifling expense; a conch-shell might stand on your mantel, to be taken up and held to the ear, that you may be soothed by its continual lulling sound, when you feel the blue fit stealing over you.
",
"
",
"It should be placed on a bracket in the pier.
",
"
",
"But perhaps the best of all is a shelf of merrily-bound books, containing comedies, farces, songs, and humorous novels.
",
"
",
"You need never open them; only have the titles in plain sight.
",
"
",
"But of all chamber furniture in the world, best calculated to cure a had temper, and breed a pleasant one, is the sight of a lovely wife.
",
"
",
"If you have children, however, that are teething, the nursery should be a good way up stairs; at sea, it ought to be in the mizzen-top.
",
"
",
"Indeed, teething children play the very deuce with a husband's temper.
",
"
",
"On the contrary, it only proves the thing which I maintain.
",
"
",
"What is more mellow than fine old ale?
",
"
",
"They messed by themselves; forming a dinner-party, not to be exceeded ire mirthfulness, by a club of young bridegrooms, three months after marriage, completely satisfied with their bargains, after testing them.
",
"
",
"Who could he a churl, and play a flageolet?
",
"
",
"And when I observed, that nearly all the First Lieutenants I saw in other men-of-war, besides many Second and Third Lieutenants, were similarly lop-sided, I knew that there must be some general law which induced the phenomenon; and I put myself to studying it out, as an interesting problem.
",
"
",
"At last, I came to the conclusion--to which I still adhere--that their so long wearing only one epaulet (for to only one does their rank entitle them) was the infallible clew to this mystery.
",
"
",
"For I had not been long on board ere I found that it would not do to be intimate with everybody.
",
"
",
"Though I was above a year in the frigate, there were scores of men who to the last remained perfect strangers to me, whose very names I did not know, and whom I would hardly be able to recognise now should I happen to meet them in the streets.
",
"
",
"My friend Nord was a somewhat remarkable character; and if mystery includes romance, he certainly was a very romantic one.
",
"
",
"In a word, he seemed desirous of hinting, that his list of man-of war friends was already made up, complete, and full; and there was no room for more.
",
"
",
"But observing that the only man he ever consorted with was Lemsford, I had too much magnanimity, by going off in a pique at his coldness, to let him lose forever the chance of making so capital an acquaintance as myself.
",
"
",
"Besides, I saw it in his eye, that the man had been a reader of good books; I would have staked my life on it, that he seized the right meaning of Montaigne.
",
"
",
"I saw that he was an earnest thinker; I more than suspected that he had been bolted in the mill of adversity.
",
"
",
"He amazed me, as much as Coleridge did the troopers among whom he enlisted.
",
"
",
"What could have induced such a man to enter a man-of-war, all my sapience cannot fathom.
",
"
",
"And how he managed to preserve his dignity, as he did, among such a rabble rout was equally a mystery.
",
"
",
"This much was observable, however, that he faithfully discharged whatever special duties devolved upon him; and was so fortunate as never to render himself liable to a reprimand.
",
"
",
"No such tales had Nord to tell.
",
"
",
"For anything that dropped from him, none of us could be sure that he had ever existed till now.
",
"
",
"My other friend, Williams, was a thorough-going Yankee from Maine, who had been both a peddler and a pedagogue in his day.
",
"
",
"He had all manner of stories to tell about nice little country frolics, and would run over an endless list of his sweethearts.
",
"
",
"It is their great "prospect in life."
",
"
",
"I have known several forlorn individuals, shipping as landsmen, who have confessed to me, that having contracted a love for ardent spirits, which they could not renounce, and having by their foolish courses been brought into the most abject poverty--insomuch that they could no longer gratify their thirst ashore--they incontinently entered the Navy; regarding it as the asylum for all drunkards, who might there prolong their lives by regular hours and exercise, and twice every day quench their thirst by moderate and undeviating doses.
",
"

"But every seaman knew, at the time, that the Captain's order was an unwise one in the extreme; perhaps worse than unwise.

",
"So he was.

"But here we only see the virtue of being placed in a station constantly demanding a cool head and steady nerves, and the misfortune of filling a post that does _not_ at all times demand these qualities.

"This kind of merely manual valour is often born of trepidation at the heart.

"It is one of the most common punishments for very trivial offences in the Navy, to "stop" a seaman's _grog_ for a day or a week.

"How such a most unmartial vagabond had insinuated himself into the honourable marine corps was a perfect mystery.

"Ordinarily, the appearance of these things for the Purser and other ward-room gentlemen occasioned no surprise; for almost every day some bundle or other is coming off for them, especially for the Purser; and, as the master-at-arms was always present on these occasions, it was an easy matter for him to hurry the smuggled liquor out of sight, and, under pretence of carrying the box or bundle down to the Purser's room, hide it away upon his own premises.

"There was a fine polish about his whole person, and a pliant, insinuating style in his conversation, that was, socially, quite irresistible.
",
"
",
"But in his conversation there was no trace of evil; nothing equivocal; he studiously shunned an indelicacy, never swore, and chiefly abounded in passing puns and witticisms, varied with humorous contrasts between ship and shore life, and many agreeable and racy anecdotes, very tastefully narrated.

",
"But, however it was, I, for one, regarded this master-at-arms with mixed feelings of detestation, pity, admiration, and something op-posed to enmity.

",

",
"
",
"He kindly acquiesced and the thing was done.
",
"
",
"Here it behooves me once again to describe my jacket; for, as a portrait taken at one period of life will not answer for a later stage; much more this jacket of mine, undergoing so many changes, needs to be painted again and again, in order truly to present its actual appearance at any given period.

"But in a nation under a liberal Constitution, it must ever be unwise to make too distinct and peculiar the profession of either branch of its military men.

"But brandy had been his bane.

"For this unpardonable offence he was broken.

"
",
"But all these lessons, so biting-bitter to learn, could not cure him of his sin.
",
"
",
"He had hardly been a week on board the Neversink, when he was found intoxicated with smuggled spirits.
",

",
"The conduct of Mandeville, in claiming the acquaintance of the First Lieutenant under such disreputable circumstances was strongly contrasted by the behaviour of another person on board, placed for a time in a somewhat similar situation.

""I can't keep it to myself any more," he said; "I must have a confidant, or I shall go mad!"

",
""That is my own brother," said he; "he must have got a reefer's warrant since I left home.

",
"Would you run?
",

",
"Do you think there is any chance to desert?
",

",
""Why, Frank," said I, "I do not really see sufficient cause for this fit you are in.
",
"
",
"Your brother is an of officer--very good; and you are nothing but a sailor--but that is no disgrace.
",
"
",
"If he comes on board here, go up to him, and take him by the hand; believe me, he will be glad enough to see you!"
",
"
",
"Amazed at his earnestness, and hardly able to account for it altogether, I stood silent a moment; then said, "Why, Frank, this midshipman is your own brother, you say; now, do you really think that your own flesh and blood is going to give himself airs over you, simply because he sports large brass buttons on his coat?
",
"
",
"Never believe it.
",
"
",
"If he does, he can be no brother, and ought to be hanged--that's all!"
",
"
",
""Don't say that again," said Frank, resentfully; "my brother is a noble-hearted fellow; I love him as I do myself.
",
"
",
"Do you suppose, now, I want my brother to see me a lackey abroad here?
",
"
",
"By Heaven it is enough to drive one distracted!
",
"
",
"What's to be done?"
",
"
",
"Upon his return, I was all eagerness to learn what had happened, and, as the communication of his feelings was a grateful relief, he poured his whole story into my ear.
",
"
",
"No; he was too tall--too large.
",
"
",
"it was not him.
",
"
",
"And perhaps his brother had not sailed from home, after all; there might have been some mistake.
",
"
",
""How my heart thumped," he said, "when I actually, felt him so near me; but I wouldn't look at him--no!
",
"
",
"I'd have died first!"
",
"
",
"He hailed it; but no reply.
",
"
",
""Give the word, or I fire!"
",
"
",
"Not a word was heard.
",
"
",
"The extreme misery and general prostration of the man, caused by the great effusion of blood--though, strange to say, at first he said he felt no pain from the wound itself--induced the Surgeon, very reluctantly, to forego an immediate search for the ball, to extract it, as that would have involved the dilating of the wound by the knife; an operation which, at that juncture, would have been almost certainly attended with fatal results.
",
"
",
"A day or two, therefore, was permitted to pass, while simple dressings were applied.
",
"
",
"Nor was he at all blind to the dignity of his position; to which, indeed, he was rendered peculiarly competent, if the reputation he enjoyed was deserved.
",
"
",
"He was a small, withered man, nearly, perhaps quite, sixty years of age.
",
"
",
"In private, he had once been heard to say, confidentially, that he would rather cut off a man's arm than dismember the wing of the most delicate pheasant.
",
"
",
"But when you first beheld it, no such emotions ever crossed your mind.
",
"
",
"It was immovably fixed to a bracket, against the partition of his state-room, so that it was the first object that greeted his eyes when he opened them from his nightly sleep.
",
"
",
"Descending to the ward-room, Cuticle spied the note, and no sooner read it, than, clutching the case, he opened it, and exclaimed, "Beautiful!
",
"
",
"I have never seen a finer specimen of this most interesting disease."
",
"
",
""What have you there, Surgeon Cuticle?"
",
"
",
""Why, sir, look at it; did you ever see anything more exquisite?"
",
"
",
""Very exquisite indeed; let me have a bit of it, will you, Cuticle?"
",
"
",
"You are not making collections!"
",
"
",
""I'm fond of the article," said the Lieutenant; "it's a fine cold relish to bacon or ham.
",
"
",
""Hand it to me, and see whether I will not," was the reply.
",
"
",
"Enough.
",
"
",
"Yet you could not say that Cuticle was essentially a cruel-hearted man.
",
"
",
"His apparent heartlessness must have been of a purely scientific origin.
",
"
",
"It is not to be imagined even that Cuticle would have harmed a fly, unless he could procure a microscope powerful enough to assist him in experimenting on the minute vitals of the creature.
",
"
",
"And this, in courtesy, his brother surgeons expect.
",
"
",
"In a body they bowed as he approached, and accosted him with deferential regard.
",
"
",
"You have all seen the patient, I believe.
",
"
",
"At first I had hopes that I should have been able to cut down to the ball, and remove it; but the state of the patient forbade.
",
"
",
"Since then, the inflammation and sloughing of the part has been attended with a copious suppuration, great loss of substance, extreme debility and emaciation.
",
"
",
"In fact, there can be no doubt that the wound is incurable, and that amputation is the only resource.
",
"
",
"But, gentlemen, I find myself placed in a very delicate predicament.
",
"
",
"I assure you I feel no professional anxiety to perform the operation.
",
"
",
"I desire your advice, and if you will now again visit the patient with me, we can then return here and decide what is best to be done.
",
"
",
""Gentlemen," began Cuticle, again seating himself, "you have now just inspected the limb; you have seen that there is no resource but amputation; and now, gentlemen, what do you say?
",
"
",
"Surgeon Bandage, of the Mohawk, will you express your opinion?"
",
"
",
""Can anything save him but amputation?"
",
"
",
""His constitutional debility is extreme," observed Bandage, "but I have seen more dangerous cases."
",
"
",
""Surgeon Wedge, of the Malay," said Cuticle, in a pet, "be pleased to give _your_ opinion; and let it be definitive, I entreat:" this was said with a severe glance toward Bandage.
",
"
",
"Is not amputation the only resource, sir?"
",
"
",
""Excuse me," said Sawyer, "I am decidedly opposed to it; for if hitherto the patient has not been strong enough to undergo the extraction of the ball, I do not see how he can be expected to endure a far more severe operation.
",
"
",
"As there is no immediate danger of mortification, and you say the ball cannot be reached without making large incisions, I should support him, I think, for the present, with tonics, and gentle antiphlogistics, locally applied.
",
"
",
""Surgeon Patella, of the Algerine," said Cuticle, in an ill-suppressed passion, abruptly turning round on the person addressed, "will _you_ have the kindness to say whether _you_ do not think that amputation is the only resource?"
",
"
",
"Now Patella was the youngest of the company, a modest man, filled with a profound reverence for the science of Cuticle, and desirous of gaining his good opinion, yet not wishing to commit himself altogether by a decided reply, though, like Surgeon Sawyer, in his own mind he might have been clearly against the operation.
",
"
",
""What you have remarked, Mr.
",
"
",
"Still, it is a very critical case, and amputation may be indispensable; and if it is to be performed, there ought to be no delay whatever.
",
"
",
"That is my view of the case, Mr.
",
"
",
""Surgeon Patella, then, gentlemen," said Cuticle, turning round triumphantly, "is clearly of opinion that amputation should be immediately performed.
",
"
",
"For my own part--individually, I mean, and without respect to the patient--I am sorry to have it so decided.
",
"
",
"But this settles the question, gentlemen--in my own mind, however, it was settled before.
",
"
",
"At ten o'clock to-morrow morning the operation will be performed.
",
"
",
"I shall be happy to see you all on the occasion, and also your juniors" (alluding to the absent _Assistant Surgeons_).
",
"
",
""Good-morning, gentlemen; at ten o'clock, remember."
",
"
",
"And Cuticle retreated to the Ward-room.
",
"
",
"They were accompanied by their juniors, young men ranging in age from nineteen years to thirty.
",
"
",
"As in honour of the occasion, they had put on their best coats; they looked exceedingly brilliant.
",
"
",
"Upon this occasion, to do duty as an amputation-table, it was widened by an additional plank.
",
"
",
"Why this object was here, will presently be seen; but why it was placed immediately at the foot of the amputation-table, only Surgeon Cuticle can tell.
",
"
",
"Is it not so, Surgeon Patella?"
",
"
",
""Certainly," said Patella, "amputation is your only resource, Mr.
",
"
",
"Surgeon of the Fleet; that is, I mean, if you are fully persuaded of its necessity."
",
"
",
"The other surgeons said nothing, maintaining a somewhat reserved air, as if conscious that they had no positive authority in the case, whatever might be their own private opinions; but they seemed willing to behold, and, if called upon, to assist at the operation, since it could not now be averted.
",
"
",
""We shall see," was the reply, and the speaker clapped his hand to his fob, to see if his watch would be forthcoming when wanted.
",
"
",
""Are you all ready here?"
",
"
",
"Ah, those were happy days!"
",
"
",
""Excuse an old man's emotions, young gentlemen; but when I think of the numerous rare cases that then came under my treatment, I cannot but give way to my feelings.
",
"
",
"From having no military marine herself, Mexico has always been backward in furnishing subjects for the amputation-tables of foreign navies.
",
"
",
"The army, young gentlemen, is your best school; depend upon it.
",
"
",
"You will hardly believe it, Surgeon Bandage," turning to that gentleman, "but this is my first important case of surgery in a nearly three years' cruise.
",
"
",
"No one, sir, could have made an amputation of it, without severely contusing his conscience.
",
"
",
"And mine--I may say it, gentlemen, without ostentation is--peculiarly susceptible."
",
"
",
"Steward, take off my coat--so; my neckerchief now; I must be perfectly unencumbered, Surgeon Patella, or I can do nothing whatever."
",
"
",
"Thus divested of nearly all inorganic appurtenances, what was left of the Surgeon slightly shook itself, to see whether anything more could be spared to advantage.
",
"
",
"With natural curiosity, these men had purposely been lingering, to see all they could; but now, having no further excuse, they snatched up their hammers and chisels, and--like the stage-builders decamping from a public meeting at the eleventh hour, after just completing the rostrum in time for the first speaker--the Carpenter's gang withdrew.
",
"
",
""And now, young gentlemen," said Cuticle, turning to the Assistant Surgeons, "while the patient is coming to, permit me to describe to you the highly-interesting operation I am about to perform."
",
"
",
""Mr.
",
"
",
"Surgeon of the Fleet," said Surgeon Bandage, "if you are about to lecture, permit me to present you with your teeth; they will make your discourse more readily understood."
",
"
",
""In the first place, now, young gentlemen, let me direct your attention to the excellent preparation before you.
",
"
",
"I have had it unpacked from its case, and set up here from my state-room, where it occupies the spare berth; and all this for your express benefit, young gentlemen.
",
"
",
"But we have no time to examine it now.
",
"
",
"_Here_, young gentlemen, _here_ is the place.
",
"
",
"You perceive it is very near the point of articulation with the trunk."
",
"
",
""Yes," interposed Surgeon Wedge, rising on his toes, "yes, young gentlemen, the point of articulation with the _acetabulum_ of the _os innominatum_."
",
"
",
""Surgeon Wedge," said Cuticle, looking round severely, "we will dispense with your commentaries, if you please, at present.
",
"
",
""I tell you it is not an uncommon thing for the patient to betray some emotion upon these occasions--most usually manifested by swooning; it is quite natural it should be so.
",
"
",
"But we must not delay the operation.
",
"
",
"He is coming to, I think"--feeling the top-man's wrist.
",
"
",
""Are you all ready, sir?"
",
"
",
"said Cuticle.
",
"
",
"Instantly it was in his hand.
",
"
",
"Full of the operation, he was about to apply it, when, looking up, and turning to the assistant surgeons, he said, "Would any of you young gentlemen like to apply the saw?
",
"
",
"A splendid subject!"
",
"
",
""Away, butcher!
",
"
",
"you disgrace the profession.
",
"
",
"They are quite at your service, sir."
",
"
",
""Do, Sawyer; be prevailed upon," said Surgeon Bandage.
",
"
",
"But you noticed that I did not use the tourniquet; I never do.
",
"
",
"The forefinger of my steward is far better than a tourniquet, being so much more manageable, and leaving the smaller veins uncompressed.
",
"
",
"For the padded points at the end of the arches"--arching his forefinger and thumb--"can be so worked as to approximate in such a way, as to--but you don't attend to me, young gentlemen," he added, all at once starting.
",
"
",
"Being more interested in the active proceedings of Surgeon Sawyer, who was now threading a needle to sew up the overlapping of the stump, the young gentlemen had not scrupled to turn away their attention altogether from the lecturer.
",
"
",
"That ball, young gentlemen, must have taken a most circuitous route.
",
"
",
"But examples of foreign substances being received into the body with a ball, young gentlemen, are frequently observed.
",
"
",
"Let this sink deep in your minds, young gentlemen; and, Surgeon Wedge "--with a stiff bow--"permit me to submit the reflection to yourself.
",
"
",
"But, Surgeon Sawyer, perhaps you may desire to wash your hands before you go.
",
"
",
"There is the basin, sir; you will find a clean towel on the rammer.
",
"
",
""I must leave you now, gentlemen"--bowing.
",
"
",
""To-morrow, at ten, the limb will be upon the table, and I shall be happy to see you all upon the occasion.
",
"
",
"Who's there?"
",
"
",
"Good-morning;" and Cuticle departed.
",
"
",
""Oh, no!"
",
"
",
"Every time she drew near, we complimented her by lowering our ensign a little, and invariably she courteously returned the salute.
",
"
",
"But we Americans can show but few similar trophies, though, no doubt, we would much like to be able so to do.
",
"
",
"asked I; "and why marches he here?
",
"
",
"Do you straighten yourself to think that you have committed a murder, when a chance-falling stone has often done the same?
",
"
",
"And you account it so glorious, do you, to mutilate and destroy what God himself was more than a quarter of a century in building?

"
",
"Come on, Rainbow and Cross!"

"
",
"Did you ever read him?
",
"
",
"William Julius Mickle?

"

"Did you ever see his ballad of Cumnor Hall?--No?--Why, it gave Sir Walter Scott the hint of Kenilworth.

"Were you ever in Malta?

"They say a piece of it is good for a charm against shipwreck; but I never tried it.
",
"
",
"There's Shelley, he was quite a sailor.
",
"
",
"a Percy, too--but they ought to have let him sleep in his sailor's grave--he was drowned in the Mediterranean, you know, near Leghorn--and not burn his body, as they did, as if he had been a bloody Turk.
",
"
",
"there never was a very great man yet who spent all his life inland.
",
"
",
"But look!
",
"
",
""See nothing, sir."

"
",
"Thenceforward all her Captains, on all cruises, _trimmed her by the head;_ and the Neversink gained the name of a clipper.

"To return.

"

"They played with great gun-rammers.
",
"
",
"_Head-bumping_, as patronised by Captain Claret, consists in two negroes (whites will not answer) butting at each other like rams.
",
"
",
"This pastime was an especial favourite with the Captain.
",
"
",
"How can they have the heart?
",
"
",
"Methinks, if but once I smiled upon a man--never mind how much beneath me--I could not bring myself to condemn him to the shocking misery of the lash.
",
"
",
"That potentate who most condescends, mark him well; for that potentate, if occasion come, will prove your uttermost tyrant.
",
"
",
"Poor mulatto!
",
"
",
"thought I; poor mulatto!
",
"
",
"Heaven send you a release from your humiliation!
",
"
",
"What that station is, should be made known to him by the First Lieutenant; and when the word is passed to _tack_ or _wear_, it is every seaman's duty to be found at his post.
",
"
",
"Indeed, I subsequently discovered, that such was the state of discipline--in this one particular, at least--that very few of the seamen could tell where their proper stations were, at _tacking or wearing_.
",
"
",
""What for?"
",
"
",
""What am I wanted for?"
",
"
",
"I repeated.
",
"
",
""Why were you not at your station, sir?"
",
"
",
""What station do you mean, sir?"
",
"
",
"said I.
",
"
",
""What station, sir, do you mean?"
",
"
",
"said I.
",
"
",
""You pretend ignorance," he replied; "it will not help you, sir."
",
"
",
""Captain Claret," said I, "it is the first time I ever heard of my being assigned to that post."
",
"
",
""How is this, Mr.
",
"
",
"he said, turning to the First Lieutenant, with a fault-finding expression.
",
"
",
""It is impossible, sir," said that officer, striving to hide his vexation, "but this man must have known his station."
",
"
",
""I have never known it before this moment, Captain Claret," said I.
",
"
",
"he returned.
",
"
",
""I shall flog you."
",
"
",
"No, I felt my man's manhood so bottomless within me, that no word, no blow, no scourge of Captain Claret could cut me deep enough for that.
",
"
",
"No other way could I escape the scourge.
",
"
",
"Nature has not implanted any power in man that was not meant to be exercised at times, though too often our powers have been abused.
",
"
",
"said Captain Claret; "do you hear?"
",
"
",
""I know that man," said Colbrook, touching his cap, and speaking in a mild, firm, but extremely deferential manner; "and I know that he would not be found absent from his station, if he knew where it was."
",
"
",
"This speech was almost unprecedented.
",
"
",
"The very unusualness of his interference seemed Colbrook's protection.
",
"
",
"He had seen more than half a century of the most active service, and, through all, had proved himself a good and faithful man.
",
"
",
"That look is the fadeless, ever infantile immortality within.
",
"
",
"You might tarry in Constantinople a month, and never catch a glimpse of the Sultan.
",
"
",
"He then turns and makes off to his division, perhaps passing several brother Lieutenants, all bound on the same errand he himself has just achieved.
",
"
",
"The other hand is continually bobbing up and down to the leather front of his cap, in response to the reports and salute of his subordinates, to whom he never deigns to vouchsafe a syllable, merely going through the motions of accepting their news, without bestowing thanks for their pains.
",
"
",
"But as for the First Lieutenant, he ought to have extra pay allowed to him, on account of his extraordinary outlays in cap fronts; for he it is to whom, all day long, reports of various kinds are incessantly being made by the junior Lieutenants; and no report is made by them, however trivial, but caps are touched on the occasion.
",
"
",
""Now I have him!"
",
"
",
"Brought so close together, twice every day, for more than a year, we could not but become intimately acquainted with each other's faces.
",
"
",
"To this fortunate circumstance it is to be ascribed, that some time after reaching home, we were able to recognise each other when we chanced to meet in Washington, at a ball given by the Russian Minister, the Baron de Bodisco.
",
"
",
"Like many other gentlemen, he appeared to the best advantage, and was treated with the most deference in the bosom of his home, the frigate.

"Our morning and evening quarters were agreeably diversified for some weeks by a little circumstance, which to some of us at least, always seemed very pleasing.

"
",
"He was accompanied by a very beautiful wife, and a still more beautiful little daughter, about six years old.
",
"
",
""_Shall suffer death!_" This was the burden of nearly every Article read by the Captain's clerk; for he seemed to have been instructed to omit the longer Articles, and only present those which were brief and to the point.
",
"
",
"After it has been repeated again and again, you listen to the reader as he deliberately begins a new paragraph; you hear him reciting the involved, but comprehensive and clear arrangement of the sentence, detailing all possible particulars of the offence described, and you breathlessly await, whether _that_ clause also is going to be concluded by the discharge of the terrible minute-gun.
",
"
",
"it again booms on your ear--_shall suffer death!_ No reservations, no contingencies; not the remotest promise of pardon or reprieve; not a glimpse of commutation of the sentence; all hope and consolation is shut out--_shall suffer death!_ that is the simple fact for you to digest; and it is a tougher morsel, believe White-Jacket when he says it, than a forty-two-pound cannon-ball.

"This young man never indulged in frivolous conversation; he only talked of the surgeon's prescriptions; his every word was a bolus.
",

",
"He never was known to smile; nor did he even look sober in the ordinary way; but his countenance ever wore an aspect of cadaverous resignation to his fate.
",
"
",
"He generally opened his shop for an hour or two every morning and evening.
",
"
",
"Several times when I felt in need of a little medicine, but was not ill enough to report myself to the surgeon at his levees, I would call of a morning upon his steward at the Sign of the Mortar, and beg him to give me what I wanted; when, without speaking a word, this cadaverous young man would mix me my potion in a tin cup, and hand it out through the little opening in his door, like the boxed-up treasurer giving you your change at the ticket-office of a theatre.
",
"
",
"But there was a little shelf against the wall of the door, and upon this I would set the tin cup for a while, and survey it; for I never was a Julius Caesar at taking medicine; and to take it in this way, without a single attempt at dis-guising it; with no counteracting little morsel to hurry down after it; in short to go to the very apothecary's in person, and there, at the counter, swallow down your dose, as if it were a nice mint-julep taken at the bar of a hotel--_this_ was a bitter bolus indeed.
",
"
",
"But, then, this pallid young apothecary charged nothing for it, and _that_ was no small satisfaction; for is it not remarkable, to say the least, that a shore apothecary should actually charge you money--round dollars and cents--for giving you a horrible nausea?

"Seldom or never did it do me any lasting good.

"If anything is going on in any of its departments which he judges to be detrimental to the healthfulness of the crew, he has a right to protest against it formally to the Captain.

"When a man is being scourged at the gangway, the Surgeon stands by; and if he thinks that the punishment is becoming more than the culprit's constitution can well bear, he has a right to interfere and demand its cessation for the time.
",

",
"Sooner might you tame the grizzly bear of Missouri than humanise a thing so essentially cruel and heartless.
",
"
",
"He asked me whether any of my family were consumptive; whether I ever felt a tendency to a rush of blood to the head; whether I was gouty; how often I had been bled during my life; how long I had been ashore; how long I had been afloat; with several other questions which have altogether slipped my memory.
",
"
",
"It was a leading question which somewhat staggered me, but I said not a word; when, feeling of my calves, he looked up and incomprehensibly said, "I am afraid you are not."

",
"
",
"Presidents of Peace Societies and Superintendents of Sabbath-schools, must it not have been a most interesting sight?
",
"
",
"But the Professor himself was a noteworthy person.
",
"
",
"In early life he had been a cadet in the military academy of West Point; but, becoming very weak-sighted, and thereby in a good manner disqualified for active service in the field, he had declined entering the army, and accepted the office of Professor in the Navy.
",
"
",
"His studies at West Point had thoroughly grounded him in a knowledge of gunnery; and, as he was not a little of a pedant, it was sometimes amusing, when the sailors were at quarters, to hear him criticise their evolutions at the batteries.
",
"
",
"He had arrived at his knowledge of tactics by silent, solitary study, and earnest meditation in the sequestered retreat of his state-room.
",
"
",
"This done, with a cutlass he would point out every spot of interest.
",
"
",
""Blaze away, by all means!"
",
"
",
"responded a rather confident reefer, who had zealously been observing the diagram.
",
"
",
""Wait till he _does_ come in range, and _then_ blaze away," said the reefer.
",
"
",
""Permit me to remark, Mr. Pert, that '_blaze away_' is not a strictly technical term; and also permit me to hint, Mr. Pert, that you should consider the subject rather more deeply before you hurry forward your opinion."
",
"
",
"This rebuke not only abashed Mr. Pert, but for a time intimidated the rest; and the professor was obliged to proceed, and extricate the British fleet by himself.
",
"
",
"He concluded by awarding Admiral Rodney the victory, which must have been exceedingly gratifying to the family pride of the surviving relatives and connections of that distinguished hero.
",
"
",
"now asked Mr. Pert, brightening up.

"Her bowsprit is gone; her rudder is torn away; she has one hundred round shot in her hull, and two thirds of her men are dead or dying.

""Well, sir," said Mr.
",
"
",
"I would, by Jove!"
",

",
"
",
""And why so?
",
"
",
"of what service would _that_ be, I should like to know, Mr.
",
"
",
""I can't tell exactly; but I think it would help her a little," was the timid reply.
",
"
",
""Well, sir," cried Mr.

"They are rated as _able seamen_ or _ordinary seamen_, and receive their wages as such; but in addition to this, they are liberally recompensed for their professional services.

"Considering the circumstances, however, not much objection can be made to the barbers on this score.
",
"
",
"But there were instances of men in the Neversink receiving government money in part pay for work done for private individuals.
",
"
",
"At what?
",
"
",
"What did the Captain pay them for their trouble?
",
"
",
"Nothing.
",

",
"To return.
",
"
",
"Their furniture, however, was not very elaborate, hardly equal to the sumptuous appointments of metropolitan barbers.
",
"
",
"No Psyche glasses; no hand-mirror; no ewer and basin; no comfortable padded footstool; nothing, in short, that makes a shore "_shave_" such a luxury.
",
"
",
"But this is no matter for wonder, since so many chins are to be shaven, and a razor-case holds but two razors.
",
"
",
"No private brushes and boxes; no reservations whatever.

"It needs that this sad and most serious matter should be faithfully detailed.
",

",
"They said it was unseamanlike; not _ship-shape;_ in short, it was disgraceful to the Navy.
",

",
"But, to do him justice--as I always have done--the Captain's beard did not exceed the limits prescribed by the Navy Department.

"But legislators do not always square their statutes by those of the Bible.

"A pretty set of savages, thought he, am I taking home to America; people will think them all catamounts and Turks.

"Besides, now that I think of it, it's against the law.
",
"
",
"It will never do.
",
"
",
"They must be shaven and shorn--that's flat.
",
"
",
"There is no knowing, indeed, whether these were the very words in which the Captain meditated that night; for it is yet a mooted point among metaphysicians, whether we think in words or whether we think in thoughts.
",
"
",
"He was afterwards discovered to have been tipsy at the time.
",
"
",
"This was an amendment, to be sure; but what barbarity, after all!

"The multitude of the dispirited vanquished were obliged to acquiesce; but many Saxon Franklins and gentlemen of spirit, choosing rather to lose their castles than their mustaches, voluntarily deserted their firesides, and went into exile.

"But though, from peculiar circumstances, his case occasioned a good deal of indignation among the people of the Neversink, yet, upon its own proper grounds, they did not denounce it.
",
"
",
"And here, though the subject of punishment in the Navy has been canvassed in previous chapters, and though the thing is every way a most unpleasant and grievous one to enlarge upon, and though I painfully nerve myself to it while I write, a feeling of duty compels me to enter upon a branch of the subject till now undiscussed.
